# Stable diffusion with streamlit

This is a homework assignment for a computer workshop in the third semester (SPbU SE) related to neural networks.
## About
In this project, we implemented the streamlit application for working with neural networks (stable diffusion for generating images from text entered by the user).
Note that image generation in this project takes place using a CPU.

## Usage
To start working with the application, first install all the necessary dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And then you can run it:
```
streamlit run src/main.py
```
